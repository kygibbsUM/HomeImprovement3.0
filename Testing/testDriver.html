    <h3> There should be some examples of the javascript stuff working here.</h3>
    <p>Setting shingle price to 25.00, paint price to 30.00, shinlge coverage to 33.3, paint coverage to 350.</p>
    <script>
        shinglePrice = 25.00;
        paintPrice = 30.00;
        shingleCoverage = 33.3;
        paintCoverage = 350;
    </script>
    <p>Setting roof size to 100 x 150, rise and run to 8 and 12, and room size to 12 x 13 x 8</p>
    <script>
        roofX = 100;
        roofY = 150;
        roomX = 12;

        roomZ = 8;
        roofRise = 8;
        roofRun = 12;
    </script>
    <p>Testing to see if this stuff actually works.</p>
    <script>

        calculateRoof(roofX, roofY, roofPitch);
        calculateRoofPrice(shingleBundles, shinglePrice);
    </script>
    <p>roof pitch should be
    <script>document.write(roofPitch);</script></p>
    <p>roof area should be
    <script>document.write(roofArea);</script></p>
    <p>room area should be
    <script>document.write(paintArea);</script></p>
    <p>paint price should be $<script>document.write(paintTotalPrice);</script></p>
    <p>bundles of shingles needed should be should be <script>document.write(shingleBundles);</script></p>
    <p>roof price should be $<script>document.write(totalRoofPrice);</script></p>
